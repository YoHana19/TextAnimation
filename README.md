# Text Animation with TextMesh Pro(ver 1.3.0)  
  
Top one is text morphing. You can morph origin text to target text that u like, but the num of character of two texts has to be same.  
This uses ComputeBuffer(without ComputeShader), and it's only good for DX11(and DX12).  

Bottom one is scatter Text. Using Geometry Shader, each of characters will be scatterer for random direction with rotating randomly.
